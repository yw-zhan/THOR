# THOR
THOR demo on MIRFlickr dataset and NUS-WIDE dataset.

Paper : THOR: Three-Step Hashing for Online Cross-Modal Retrieval

This is a simplified demo, including:  
train0.m: function to compute the hash code and hash function of training data at the first chunk.    
train.m: function to compute the hash code and hash function of training data at other chunk.    
evaluate.m: function to evaluate the performence of THOR.  
mAP.m : function to compute the mAP of hashing method.  
demo_main.m: example script to run the code on the MIRFLickr and NUS-WIDE dataset.
